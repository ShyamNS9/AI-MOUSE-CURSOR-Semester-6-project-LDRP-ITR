## INTRODUCTION
   This is the repository where our team will push all the learning codes and implementation codes from which we have made our project called AI MOUSE CURSOR.     
   AI MOUSE CURSOR is a type of software you can say by which we can control our screen cursor with the help of hand movements and hand gestures without any physical key press
   or without any touch on the trackpad.
